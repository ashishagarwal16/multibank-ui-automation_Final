# MultiBank UI Automation – Task 2: Character Frequency

## Overview

This project contains a **TestNG-based Java implementation** to calculate the **frequency of characters in a string** while maintaining the order of their first appearance. It demonstrates a **clean, reusable design**, **data-driven testing**, and professional **automation practices**, suitable for integration into larger automation frameworks.

---

## Features

* Count occurrences of each character in a string.
* Maintains order of first appearance (LinkedHashMap).
* Handles **edge cases**: empty strings and null input.
* **Data-driven tests** using TestNG `DataProvider`.
* Modular architecture:

  * **Utility class** (`CharacterFrequencyUtil`) for logic.
  * **Test class** (`CharacterFrequencyTest`) for execution and assertions.
* Easily extendable for external test data.
